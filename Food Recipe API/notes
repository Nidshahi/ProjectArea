 use the csv-parser to read the csv data from the file. Start by importing the fs module which will help in read the file and csv-parser which help in parsing the content read from the file, into js objects.
 we have to provide the path to the file as an argument to the createReadStream function. It will create a stream object which has a method called pipe. pipe method is just like pipe | symbol in linux where we pass output of one command as input to the other command.
 Here, this method also takes the stream and passed it to the csvParser. Now every time the csvParser parses a line it will generate an event called "data". We can pass a callback function to this event and do what ever we want which that data.
 res.json() is an Express.js method that converts the response data into JSON format and sends it as the response to the client.
 "stream" refers to a continuous flow of data that is being read from or written to.
 Readable Stream: The fs.createReadStream(csvFilePath) creates a readable stream that reads data from the CSV file (csvFilePath). It reads the file piece by piece, or chunk by chunk, rather than loading the entire file into memory at once. This is especially useful for large files because it allows you to start processing the data as soon as the first chunk is available, without waiting for the entire file to be read.

Writable Stream: The csv() function creates a writable stream that receives data and processes it. In this case, it transforms the CSV data into JavaScript objects or arrays, making it easier to work with CSV data in code.

pipe() Method: The .pipe() method connects the output of the readable stream (fs.createReadStream(csvFilePath)) to the input of the writable stream (csv()). It allows the data read from the file to be automatically passed through the transformation process provided by the csv() function.

So, in summary, a "stream" in this context represents the flow of data from a source (the CSV file) to a destination (the transformation process provided by the csv() function), allowing data to be processed efficiently in chunks rather than all at once.
